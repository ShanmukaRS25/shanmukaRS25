## Research-Driven Project

### CAD File Difference Application â€“ Python GUI Tool

- Developed a **Python GUI tool (PyQt5)** to compare and visualize differences between high-resolution CAD machine drawing images (`.tif`/`.tiff`).  
- Designed a **dual-pane image interface** with interactive controls (Compare, Save Difference, Next, Previous, Exit) for streamlined design validation workflows.  
- Built an **OpenCV-powered image comparison pipeline**, identifying pixel-level deviations and **highlighting changes in red** for rapid defect detection.  
- Implemented **advanced image processing methods** (noise reduction, structural similarity, pixel-difference) to ensure high-accuracy validation of CAD drawings.  
- Modularized the application into **independent components** (UI rendering, image processing, user interaction) with **robust error handling** and feedback via PyQt dialogs & structured logging. 
- Designed and executed **comprehensive test cases** on diverse CAD drawings with varying resolutions, content structures, and edge cases to validate accuracy and stability.  
- Delivered a **deployable Windows installer** using *Inno Setup* with a custom `.iss` script, ensuring smooth client-side installation with bundled dependencies.  

### The following image illustrates the image processing capabilities of the application, which enables precise analysis and visualization of CAD drawings, effectively highlighting deviations and differences.
- **Image Comparison Interface**: The application features a dual-pane layout, displaying the original CAD drawing in the left pane and the modified image in the right pane, allowing for direct visual comparison.
- **Automated Difference Highlighting**: Upon loading both images and clicking the "Compare" button, the system identifies and highlights the differences between the original and modified images, annotating the modified image with red highlights to clearly illustrate the changes.
